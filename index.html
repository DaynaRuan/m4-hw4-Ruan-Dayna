                <h3>Who is Steve Lacy?</h3>
                <p>Born Steve Thomas Lacy-Moya on May 23rd 1998 in Compton, California, is an Alternative R&B musician whose music is endlessly replayable. Steve gained recognition as a guitarist for the Grammy-nominated R&B band The Internet back in 2015 but his love for music didnt start there. Steve first gained an interest in the guitar at age seven through the video game Guitar Hero, but soon wanted to learn how to play on an actual guitar. He met former band member of The Internet, Jameel Bruner, while in the jazz band at the high school they both attended. Steve got his start producing by making beats on his iPhone.</p>

                <p>He began producing songs for Twenty88, Denzel Curry, Isaiah Rashad, J. Cole, GoldLink, Ravyn Lenae, Kendrick Lamar, and even Solange. Currently he is on the rise for his latest album, Gemini Rights which No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
